# Site Manifests
The Puppet modules contained within this directory are custom pieces of code used to configure and deploy applications
that can not otherwise be deployed using just Puppet Forge modules.

Manifests in this directory should abide by all of the Puppet syntax and style guidelines, however it is not necessary
create new modules using the Puppet Development Kit (PDK).

Be mindful of class names and always check to make sure none of the Puppet Forge modules have conflicting namespaces.
